Using Skype for video calls is a bad idea. It used to be encrypted, but since Microsoft purchased them they broke the crypto. In fact, the company is willing to hand over the voice and video recordings to various law enforcement agencies [without a warrant][1].

The solution to this problem is end-to-end encryption again. [Wire][2] is an easy to use app that encrypts video calls just like that. It is super easy to use and they are [relatively open][3] about the underlying technology.
