One method to monitor your activities online as well as your computer is backdoors on your computer. Since the breaches of the [Hacking Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team?target=_blank) and [FinFisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinFisher?target=_blank), or news from the [FBI](http://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-allows-fbi-hack-any-computer-anywhere-if-warrant-454278?target=_blank), we know that certain governmental organisations are willing to exploit computers and smartphones to install backdoors on them.

Check out the [latest addition to the guides](/guides/protect-your-pc-from-backdoors-windows) on anti-malware and anti-exploit software.
