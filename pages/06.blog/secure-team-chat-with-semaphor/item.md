When it comes to developing stories, you may need to collaborate with your peers. If you ever used Slack, you know how conventient it is. But what about security?

===

Unfortunately, not every tool is made equal. Apps like [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Rocket](https://rocket.chat) does not feature [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption?target=_blank). It means that a third-party somewhere along the way may hand over the chat logs to the authorities when a warrant is produced.

SpiderOak Semaphor is a zero-knowledge collaboration tool that features end-to-end encryption. You can chat and share files with multiple partners on this platform privately, as messages can only be decrypted by your partners.
