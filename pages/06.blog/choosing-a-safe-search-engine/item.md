The [current legislation in Australia](https://wiki.privacyforjournalists.org.au/metadata_laws) requires service provides to retain metadata for two years. In parallel, everything you type into the search bar on Google or Bing is retained along with your IP address and other relevant details. Therefore, your Internet browsing activity can be reconstructed and linked back to you by correlating the different datasets with each other. 

To avoid these data correlation issues, you can switch to a search engine that promises  not to retain any logs of your search queries. Read [our latest guide](/guides/choosing-a-safe-search-engine) for search engines that does not collect and retain anything of your search activity.
