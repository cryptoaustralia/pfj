Hard drive encryption protects from two things. Firstly, nobody can tamper with your computer (e.g. install backdoors) if you leave it unattended. Secondly, your files remain secure in case the laptop is stolen.

===

There are many situations these could happen:

* You are staying in a hotel and the laptop is left in your room unattended
* Someone breaks into your apartment or office
* The laptop is left in the trunk of the car and someone breaks into it
* Someone snatches the device from your hands, or robs you
* You are deliberately put into a situation that separates you from your device. For example a thorough security check at the airport
