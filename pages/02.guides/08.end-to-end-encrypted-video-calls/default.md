# End-to-End Encrypted Video Calls

[TOC]

There are many situations in a reporter's life to arrange a video chat with someone. For this purpose, we recommend [Wire][1] because it is open-source, and provides end-to-end encryption for video calls. Also, it is easy to use and the client software is available on multiple platforms (Windows, OS X, iPhone, Android).

Keep in mind that this application leaves metadata behind. Only use Wire if you do not mind that you and your source can be linked together.

! Skype does not provide end-to-end encryption for video calls. In fact, Microsoft hands over the recordings to various law enforcement agencies [even without a warrant][2].

## Installing Wire

* Visit [wire.com](https://wire.com?target=_blank)

* Download the application for Windows

Once it is downloaded, install the application as usual. Once it is installed, Wire will prompt you for some details for registering a new user account.

## Chat and Video Calls

Once your partner is added to the contact list, you can chat or initiate video calls from now on. Any communication will be encrypted from end to end.

! Although Wire can be installed on your mobile phone, and can send and receive end-to-end encrypted text messages, we prefer Signal for texts and phone calls. Check out the [guides][3] for installing Signal.
