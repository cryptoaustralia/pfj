# Secure Team Chat with Semaphor

[TOC]

When it comes to developing stories, you may need to collaborate with your peers. If you ever used Slack, you know how conventient it is. But what about security?

Unfortunately, not every tool is made equal. Apps like [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Rocket](https://rocket.chat) does not feature [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption?target=_blank). It means that a third-party somewhere along the way may hand over the chat logs to the authorities when a warrant is produced.

SpiderOak Semaphor is a zero-knowledge collaboration tool that features end-to-end encryption. You can chat and share files with multiple partners on this platform privately, as messages can only be decrypted by your partners.

By following this guide, you will be able to install Sempahor on your PC. You will also learn how you can create a new channel and invite others to join the conversation with you.
