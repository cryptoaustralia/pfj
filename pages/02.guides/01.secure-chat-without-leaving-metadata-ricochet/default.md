# Secure Chat With Ricochet

[TOC]

When it comes to communicating with someone, one issue is all the metadata that both parties leave behind. Unfortunately, metadata is currently retained for 2 years in Australia. 

!! Retained metadata can be correlated with each other to link jornalists and information sources together

This walkthrough is showing the installation process of [Ricochet](https://ricochet.im?target=_blank). At the end of this guide, you will have Ricochet installed on your PC. You will be able to share your Ricochet ID on Twitter, so others can contact you anonymously.

!!!! Ricochet operates through the Tor network in a decentralised manner, so metadata is not retained anywhere.
