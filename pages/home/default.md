### Protect Your Information Sources

![Big Brother is watching you](line.png)

**Privacy for Journalists** is helping reporters in Australia protect their information sources from:

* Metadata collection and retention
* Targeted surveillance
* Corporate hacking

> "Under these mandatory metadata laws you can immediately see who journalists are contacting, from which you can derive who their sources are." - **Edward Snowden** [9th May, 2015](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-08/edward-snowden-says-australias-mass-surveillance-dangerous/6456938?target=_blank)
